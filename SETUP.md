# React Setup Instructions

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:3000`

## What Changed

Your project has been converted from vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to React:

### New Structure
- `src/` - All React source code
  - `components/` - Reusable components (Navbar, Footer, StoryCard, etc.)
  - `pages/` - Page components (HomePage, ShareStoryPage, etc.)
  - `data/` - Data files (stories.js)
  - `App.jsx` - Main app with routing
  - `main.jsx` - Entry point

### Key Features
- ✅ All components converted to React
- ✅ React Router for navigation
- ✅ State management with React hooks
- ✅ Story filtering with React state
- ✅ All 23 stories in data file
- ✅ All pages converted

### Original Files
Your original HTML files are still in the root directory for reference, but the React app uses the new structure.

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start development
3. All your existing functionality should work the same, but now with React!
